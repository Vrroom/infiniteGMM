Implementation and explanation of the paper [The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs281/papers/rasmussen-1999a.pdf).

`sampler.py` Implements adaptive rejection sampling and gibbs sampling.
`distributions.py` Contains representation of a piecewise exponential distribution.
